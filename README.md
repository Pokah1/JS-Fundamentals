# JavaScript Fundamentals

This repository contains several small JavaScript scripts that demonstrate fundamental concepts and syntax of the language. These scripts are part of my **ALX Software Engineering** training.

##  Project Structure

Each `.js` file in this project is a standalone script that performs a specific task such as:

- Printing strings or variables
- Handling command-line arguments
- Using loops and conditionals
- Performing basic arithmetic
- Working with functions

##  How to Run

Each file can be run individually using Node.js:

```bash
node filename.js
